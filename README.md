# OpenInventory Backend OUTDATED Version

This version of the Openinventory-Backend is the first successful build.
It is written in Rust. I will not work on it myself anymore, but you as the community
can develop it. I will review every incomming pull request. In my opinion this is
a great project for everyone who want to develop on a growing project. 

If this backend will be in an accaptable and stable state, I will publish it as
alternative for the go backend. 


Happy coding,
Mathis Burger
